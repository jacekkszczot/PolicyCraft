- **Bias Documentation**: Transparent reporting of knowledge base composition and limitations
- **Update Protocols**: Regular review cycles for maintaining currency of academic sources

## 2. Algorithmic Fairness & Bias Mitigation

### Identified Potential Biases
- **Linguistic Representation**: Primary focus on English-language policy documents
- **Institutional Diversity**: Knowledge base may favour research-intensive university contexts
- **Geographic Scope**: Western higher education frameworks predominantly represented
- **Temporal Bias**: Recent publications (2018-2025) may not capture historical policy evolution

### Active Mitigation Strategies
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor assessment providing transparency about analysis reliability
- **Manual Review Queue**: Human oversight for documents requiring additional quality assessment
- **Diverse Training Data**: Incorporation of varied institutional contexts and policy approaches
- **Threshold Management**: Conservative confidence requirements for automated recommendations
- **Bias Monitoring**: Regular assessment of recommendation patterns across different policy types

### Fairness Evaluation Framework
- **Demographic Parity**: Monitoring for consistent performance across institution types
- **Calibration Assessment**: Ensuring confidence scores accurately reflect prediction reliability
- **Error Analysis**: Systematic review of misclassification patterns and their potential impacts
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Integration of user experiences from diverse institutional contexts

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy Safeguards

### Data Minimisation Principles
- **Essential Collection**: User data limited to functional requirements (email, secure credentials)
- **Processing Scope**: Document analysis performed locally without external transmission
- **Retention Policies**: Automated deletion of uploaded documents after analysis completion
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensuring appropriate data access restrictions

### Technical Security Measures
- **Encryption Standards**: TLS 1.3 for all communications, AES-256 for stored sensitive data
