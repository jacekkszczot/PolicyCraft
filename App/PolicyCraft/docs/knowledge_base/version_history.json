      "abstract": "This study examined the guidelines issued by the top 50 U.S. universities regard- ing the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in academic and administrative activities. Employ- ing a mixed methods approach, the research combined topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of institutional responses to GenAI. Topic modeling identified four core topics: Inte- gration of GenAI in Learning and Assessment, GenAI in Visual and Multimodal Media, Security and Ethical Considerations in GenAI, and GenAI in Academic Integrity. These themes were further explored through sentiment analysis, which revealed highly posi- tive attitudes towards GenAI across all institution types, with significant differences between faculty and student-targeted guidelines. Qualitative thematic analysis corrob- orated these findings and provided deeper insights, revealing that 94% of universities had faculty guidelines emphasizing the importance of establishing and communicat- ing course-specific GenAI policies. This analysis also highlighted recurring themes such as academic integrity and privacy concerns, which aligned with the security and ethical considerations identified in the topic modeling. The study highlights the rapid evolu- tion of GenAI guidelines in higher education and the need for flexible, stakeholder- specific policies that address both the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to develop an AI education policy for higher education by examining the perceptions and implications of text generative AI technologies. Data was collected from 457 students and 180 teachers and staff across various disciplines in Hong Kong universities, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Based on the findings, the study proposes an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework to address the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university teaching and learning. This framework is organized into three dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Opera- tional. The Pedagogical dimension concentrates on using AI to improve teaching and learning outcomes, while the Governance dimension tackles issues related to privacy, security, and accountability. The Operational dimension addresses matters concern- ing infrastructure and training. The framework fosters a nuanced understanding of the implications of AI integration in academic settings, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities and can take appropriate actions accordingly.
