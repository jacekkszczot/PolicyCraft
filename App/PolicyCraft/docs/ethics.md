# PolicyCraft: Ethical Considerations

## 1. Bias and Fairness

### Potential Issues
- **Linguistic Bias**: The model was primarily trained on English-language policies, which may affect its performance on non-English texts
- **Institutional Bias**: Training data may over-represent certain types of institutions (e.g., research-intensive universities)
- **Cultural Context**: Policy recommendations may not fully account for regional educational contexts

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular fairness audits using demographic parity metrics
- Clear documentation of model limitations in the user interface
- Ongoing collection of diverse training data to improve generalisability
- Implementation of confidence thresholds to flag potentially biased outputs

## 2. Privacy and Data Protection

### Data Collection
- **User Data**: Limited to essential account information (email, hashed password)
- **Document Processing**: All analysis occurs locally; documents are not stored longer than necessary
- **Analytics**: Anonymised usage statistics may be collected for system improvement

### Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- Secure password hashing using Bcrypt (work factor 12)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with GDPR and UK Data Protection Act 2018

## 3. Academic Integrity

### Citation and Attribution
- Automated validation of academic references against verified sources
- Clear distinction between system-generated content and direct quotations
- Transparency about the limitations of automated citation analysis

### Plagiarism Prevention
- Detection of verbatim text reuse from source materials
- Encouragement of original policy development
- Clear attribution of all external sources in recommendations

## 4. Transparency and Accountability

### Model Documentation
- Comprehensive model cards detailing training data and limitations
- Version control for all model updates
- Publicly available evaluation metrics and test results

### Decision-Making
- Clear explanation of how recommendations are generated
- Ability for users to provide feedback on suggestions
- Human oversight for critical policy decisions

## 5. Responsible Use Guidelines

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Initial policy analysis and benchmarking
- Identifying potential gaps in existing policies
- Generating draft recommendations for human review

### Limitations
- Not a substitute for expert legal or educational advice
- Should be used as part of a broader policy development process
- Institutions must consider local context and regulations

## 6. Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Mechanisms
- User feedback collection on recommendation quality
- Regular updates based on academic research
- Community contributions to the reference database

### Review Process
- Annual ethics review by an independent committee
- Regular updates to this document based on user feedback
- Public log of significant changes to the system
