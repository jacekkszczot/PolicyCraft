large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of ai. the underlying technology is key to 
further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language 
models are here to stay. this commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational appli­
cations of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. we briefly discuss the current state of 
large language models and their applications. we then highlight how these models can be used to create 
educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. with 
regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop 
sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and 
unexpected brittleness of such systems. in addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear 
pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to 
integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. other 
challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential 
for misuse are not unique to the application of ai in education. but we believe that, if handled sensibly, these 
challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with po­
tential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of ai applications. we conclude with recommendations for how to 
address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.

## Content-Based Recommendations
1. materials that align with the student’s specific learning needs.
2. grammatical or style improvements and assist in conversation practice.
3. adequate and personalized improvement strategies.
4. be accompanied by the help of professionals such as speech therapists, educators, and other spe­ cialists that can adapt the technology to the specific needs of the learner’s disabilities.
5. be done with caution, as they also have limitations such as lack of inter­ pretability and potential for bias, unexpected brittleness in relatively simple tasks (Magazine, 2022) which need to be addressed.
6. explore their potential applications in education.
7. be further explored, this E.
8. be trained on examples of such texts.
9. be integrated into the curriculum in a way that complements and en­ hances the learning experience, rather than replacing it.
10. focus on: • Research on transparency, explanation and analysis techniques and measures to distinguish machine- from human-generated text • Incentives and support to develop curricula and instructions that require the creative and complementary use of large language models.
