## Limitations & Constraints

### Language & Context
- **Primary Language**: Optimised for formal academic English (British and American variants)
- **Cultural Context**: Training data predominantly represents Western higher education frameworks
- **Domain Specificity**: Focused on higher education AI policies rather than broader policy domains
- **Temporal Scope**: Contemporary focus (2018-2025) may not capture historical policy evolution

### Technical Limitations
- **Local Processing**: Analysis performed without external API dependencies for privacy
- **Document Formats**: Optimal performance with structured PDF and Word documents
- **Scale Constraints**: Designed for institutional rather than system-wide policy analysis
- **Connectivity Requirements**: Internet access needed for initial setup and model downloads

### Analytical Boundaries
- **Policy Interpretation**: System provides analysis but cannot replace legal or regulatory expertise
- **Implementation Guidance**: Recommendations require contextualisation within specific institutional environments
- **Stakeholder Consultation**: Technical analysis supplements but does not replace human stakeholder engagement
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Local legal requirements take precedence over system suggestions

## Ethical Considerations & Safeguards

### Bias Mitigation
- **Source Diversity**: Incorporation of varied institutional contexts and policy approaches
- **Confidence Transparency**: Multi-factor assessment providing clear reliability indicators
- **Manual Oversight**: Human review queue for documents requiring additional quality assessment
- **Feedback Integration**: User experience collection for ongoing bias detection and correction

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimisation**: Processing limited to essential functional requirements
- **Local Analysis**: Document processing without external transmission or cloud storage
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensuring appropriate data access restrictions
