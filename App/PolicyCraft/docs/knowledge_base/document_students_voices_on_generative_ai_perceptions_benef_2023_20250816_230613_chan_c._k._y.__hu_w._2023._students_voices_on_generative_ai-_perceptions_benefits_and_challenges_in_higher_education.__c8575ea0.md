Generative Artificial Intelligence
Generative AI (GenAI) encompasses a group of machine learning algorithms designed 
to generate new data samples that mimic existing datasets

### Insight 6
On the other hand, there have been challenges about the limitations of GenAI and 
issues related to ethics, plagiarism, and academic integrity

### Insight 7
GenAI tools are not 
able to assess validity of content and determine whether the output they generate con-
tains falsehoods or misinformation, thus their use requires human oversight (Lubowitz, 
2023)

### Insight 8

Another reason behind the optimism was the assumption that humans would still 
maintain control and oversight over the GenAI

### Insight 10
” At least for now, they believed humans would continue to be in the loop 
and have oversight over the GenAI technologies

### Insight 11
Challenges concerning accuracy and transparency
	
Currently, GenAI can promptly provide fluent and human-sounding responses, but 
their accuracy cannot always be guaranteed

### Insight 12
” Transparency is another significant 
concern

### Insight 13
Since the development of technology has out-
paced regulatory measures, they were concerned about the potential risks such as 
governance associated with Gen AI

### Insight 14
Even for some students who 
acknowledge the positive effects of GenAI, they also believe that a policy is necessary 
currently

### Insight 15
Despite the positive outlook, the study also reveals challenges concerning GenAI tech-
nologies, with students expressing reservations about over-reliance on the technology, 
its potential impact on the value of university education, and issues related to accuracy, 
transparency, privacy, and ethics
