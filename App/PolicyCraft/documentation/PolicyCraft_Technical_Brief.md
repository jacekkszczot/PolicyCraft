# PolicyCraft - Technical Brief
*Draft for Tutor Review - 24 July 2025*

## 1. Introduction

PolicyCraft is an AI-powered platform designed to assist higher education institutions in analyzing and developing AI usage policies. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the application's functionality, focusing on its core features and technical implementation.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1 Document Analysis Engine

**Purpose:**
The system processes policy documents to extract key information and provide actionable insights.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Utilizes a hybrid approach combining rule-based and machine learning techniques
- Employs BERT for contextual understanding and TF-IDF for keyword extraction
- Implements custom classifiers for policy categorization

**User Flow:**
1. User uploads a policy document (PDF/DOCX)
2. System processes the document through multiple analysis layers
3. Results are displayed in an interactive dashboard

### 2.2 Recommendation System

**Purpose:**
Generates evidence-based suggestions for policy improvement.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Compares input against a database of 50+ institutional policies
- Uses similarity scoring to identify relevant policy elements
- Applies academic research findings to suggest improvements

**Example Output:**
```
Current Policy: "AI tools may be used with instructor permission."
Recommendation: Consider specifying which tools are permitted and under what conditions. 
Research shows that clear guidelines reduce academic misconduct cases by 34% (Smith et al., 2024).
```

## 3. User Interface Walkthrough

### 3.1 Main Dashboard

**Key Elements:**
1. **Navigation Bar**
   - Home: Returns to dashboard
   - Upload: Document submission
   - History: Previous analyses
   - Settings: User preferences

2. **Analysis Panel**
   - Real-time processing status
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Downloadable reports

### 3.2 Document Upload Interface

**File Requirements:**
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX
- Maximum size: 20MB
- Language: English (UK/US)

**Processing Steps:**
1. File validation
2. Text extraction
3. Analysis execution
4. Results compilation

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 System Components

**Frontend:**
- Responsive design (Bootstrap 5)
- Interactive visualizations (Chart.js)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)

**Backend:**
- Python 3.9+
- Flask web framework
- Asynchronous task processing (Celery)

**Database:**
- MongoDB for document storage
- SQLite for user management
- Redis for caching

### 4.2 Security Measures

- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
- Role-based access control
- Regular security audits
- GDPR compliance

## 5. Example Analysis

### 5.1 Input Document
*University X AI Policy (excerpt):*
"Students may use AI tools for initial research but must disclose all AI assistance in their submissions."

### 5.2 Processing Steps
1. **Text Extraction**
   - Removes formatting
   - Identifies key clauses
   - Tokenizes content

2. **Analysis**
   - Categorizes as "Moderate" policy
   - Identifies key elements (permission, disclosure)
   - Compares with similar policies

3. **Recommendations**
   - Suggests specific disclosure format
   - Recommends adding examples of acceptable use
   - References similar policies from peer institutions

### 5.3 Output
```
Policy Analysis Results
----------------------
Category: Moderate
Confidence: 87%

Key Elements:
- AI use permitted with conditions
- Disclosure requirement present

Recommendations:
1. Add specific disclosure format
2. Include examples of acceptable use
3. Reference academic integrity policy

Similar Policies:
- University of Example 1 (89% match)
- University of Example 2 (84% match)
```

## 6. Design Rationale

### 6.1 Technology Choices

**Why Flask?**
- Lightweight and flexible
- Excellent for API development
- Strong community support

**Why MongoDB?**
- Schema-less design for varying policy structures
- Excellent for document storage
- Horizontal scalability

### 6.2 Architecture Decisions

**Hybrid Analysis Approach**
Combines:
- Rule-based methods for structured data
- Machine learning for contextual understanding
- Human-in-the-loop validation

**Security Considerations**
- Data minimization
- Regular penetration testing
- Comprehensive logging

## 7. Future Development

### 7.1 Short-term Goals
- Expand policy database
- Add multi-language support
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

### 7.2 Long-term Vision
- Predictive policy impact analysis
- Integration with learning management systems
- Automated compliance checking

## 8. Conclusion

PolicyCraft represents a significant step forward in AI policy analysis for higher education. By combining advanced NLP techniques with a user-friendly interface, it provides institutions with valuable insights to develop comprehensive, effective AI usage policies.
