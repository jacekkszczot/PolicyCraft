"""
Integration Test Suite for PolicyCraft AI Policy Analysis Platform.

This package contains integration tests that verify the interaction between
multiple components of the PolicyCraft application. These tests ensure that
different modules work together correctly to process and analyze policy documents.

Test files in this directory should focus on testing the integration of multiple
components, such as the complete analysis pipeline from document upload to
recommendation generation.
