## Core Themes Identified:
- **Ethical Gaps**: Insufficient attention to fairness, accountability, and inclusivity in AI systems
- **Collaboration Deficits**: Need for more multi-stakeholder and international research efforts
- **Rigor Improvement**: Call for robust methodologies, including longitudinal studies and mixed-methods approaches
- **Practical Applications**: AI tools improve student engagement but risk over-reliance if not ethically managed

## Implementation Recommendations:
- **Ethical Frameworks**: Develop comprehensive AI ethics guidelines for educational use
- **Collaborative Research**: Foster partnerships across institutions and disciplines
- **Methodological Rigor**: Prioritize empirical validation and transparent reporting
- **Stakeholder Training**: Educate faculty and students on ethical AI use
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular audits of AI tools for fairness and inclusivity

## PolicyCraft Application Keywords:
