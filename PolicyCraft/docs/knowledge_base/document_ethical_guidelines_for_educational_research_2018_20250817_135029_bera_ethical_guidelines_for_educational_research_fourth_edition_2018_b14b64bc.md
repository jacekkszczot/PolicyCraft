9. consider how to foster opportunities for follow-up dialogue to reveal whether and how researchers have acted in consideration of BERA and/or local ethical principles throughout an entire study.
10. – in their research proposals, reports, funding applications, work with schools and so on – explicitly indicate how they are adhering to those points included in these guidelines that are salient to their work.
