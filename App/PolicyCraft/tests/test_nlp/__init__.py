"""
NLP Test Suite for PolicyCraft AI Policy Analysis Platform.

This package contains test modules for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) components
of the PolicyCraft application. This includes tests for text processing, theme extraction,
and policy classification functionality.

Test files in this directory should focus on testing the NLP pipeline components in isolation,
using test doubles for any external dependencies when necessary.
