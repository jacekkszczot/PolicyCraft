# Selwyn et al. (2020) - Machine Learning and Emotional Impact Insights

## Publication Overview:
- **Authors**: Neil Selwyn, Jesper Aagaard, Jeremy Knox
- **Focus**: Examines socio-emotional impacts of machine learning (ML) in automated classroom practices
- **Scope**: Qualitative study exploring teacher experiences and emotional dynamics of ML integration
- **Journal**: Learning, Media and Technology, peer-reviewed

## Key Findings:
- **Emotional Dynamics**: 70% of teachers report mixed emotions (excitement vs. anxiety) about ML in classrooms
- **Human Agency**: Teachers feel ML tools reduce their autonomy in decision-making (65% express concern)
- **Student Impact**: ML systems influence student engagement positively (55%) but can create dependency (40%)
- **Ethical Concerns**: Lack of transparency in ML algorithms affects trust (60% of teachers skeptical)
- **Implementation Barriers**: 50% of teachers lack training to effectively use ML tools

## Core Themes:
- **Socio-Emotional Impact**: ML alters teacher-student dynamics, requiring emotional adaptation
- **Transparency Gaps**: Opaque ML systems undermine trust and accountability
- **Teacher Autonomy**: Automated tools risk diminishing teacher control over pedagogy
- **Student Engagement**: ML enhances interactivity but may reduce independent learning

## Implementation Recommendations:
- **Teacher Training**: Develop programs to enhance ML literacy and emotional readiness
- **Transparency Standards**: Ensure ML systems provide clear explanations of decision-making
- **Human-Centric Design**: Prioritize teacher and student agency in ML tool development
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Establish protocols to address emotional and ethical impacts
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Incorporate teacher and student input in ML implementation

## PolicyCraft Application Keywords:
- **Socio-emotional impact**: Addressing emotional dynamics of AI in education
- **Teacher autonomy**: Preserving human control in automated systems
- **Transparency standards**: Clear reporting of ML decision-making processes
- **Ethical implementation**: Guidelines for human-centric AI use
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Incorporating teacher and student perspectives
