## Abstract
This study examined the guidelines issued by the top 50 U.S. universities regard- ing the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in academic and administrative activities. Employ- ing a mixed methods approach, the research combined topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of institutional responses to GenAI. Topic modeling identified four core topics: Inte- gration of GenAI in Learning and Assessment, GenAI in Visual and Multimodal Media, Security and Ethical Considerations in GenAI, and GenAI in Academic Integrity. These themes were further explored through sentiment analysis, which revealed highly posi- tive attitudes towards GenAI across all institution types, with significant differences between faculty and student-targeted guidelines. Qualitative thematic analysis corrob- orated these findings and provided deeper insights, revealing that 94% of universities had faculty guidelines emphasizing the importance of establishing and communicat- ing course-specific GenAI policies. This analysis also highlighted recurring themes such as academic integrity and privacy concerns, which aligned with the security and ethical considerations identified in the topic modeling. The study highlights the rapid evolu- tion of GenAI guidelines in higher education and the need for flexible, stakeholder- specific policies that address both the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology.

2. the HEIs "develop policies and clear, easy-to-understand guidelines for the use of language mod- els in learning and teaching—the guidelines should include information on the proper use of these tools and the consequence of cheating" (p.
3. the accessibility and conversational features of GenAI tools.
4. discussions on intellectual property rights and the impact of GenAI on communities.
5. the broader concept of GenAI is perceived more favorably than the spe- cific application of ChatGPT.
6. using GenAI for interactive teaching activities but emphasizes that "AI should help you teach, not teach for you.
7. using those detection tools as shown in the following quotes.
8. faculty use these tools.
