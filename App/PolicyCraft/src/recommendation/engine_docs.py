    Analyse institutional context to tailor recommendations to specific institutional profiles.
    
    This method performs a comprehensive analysis of the institutional context by examining
    both extracted themes and policy text to determine the most appropriate institutional
    classification and characteristics. The analysis considers linguistic patterns, thematic
    emphasis, and domain-specific terminology to create a detailed institutional profile.
    
    Note: This method appears to be duplicated in this file. The duplicate is located
    around line 2413. Consider consolidating these implementations in a future refactor.
    
    Args:
        themes: List of dictionaries containing extracted themes from the policy document.
               Each theme should include at minimum a 'name' key with the theme text.
               
        text: The full text of the policy document, used for additional context analysis
             when available. This parameter is optional but provides more accurate
             classification when provided.
             
    Returns:
        Dict: A dictionary containing the institutional context with the following keys:
            - type: Primary institution type ('research_university', 'teaching_focused',
                   or 'technical_institute')
            - focus_areas: List of key policy focus areas identified (e.g.,
                         'data_governance', 'academic_integrity', 'research_excellence')
            - complexity_level: Estimated policy complexity level ('low', 'medium', 'high')
            - stakeholder_emphasis: List of stakeholder groups that receive particular
                                  attention in the policy
                                  
    Example:
        >>> generator = RecommendationGenerator()
        >>> themes = [{'name': 'Research Integrity'}, {'name': 'Data Protection'}]
        >>> context = generator._analyze_institution_context(themes, policy_text)
        >>> print(context['type'])
        'research_university'
        
    Note:
        The default classification is 'research_university' when insufficient evidence is
        available to make a confident determination. The analysis is designed to be
        resilient to missing or incomplete input data.
