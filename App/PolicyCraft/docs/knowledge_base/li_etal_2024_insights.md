# Li et al. (2024) - NLP Methodology Insights for PolicyCraft

## Bibliometric Analysis Methodology:
- **Text Mining Techniques**: TF (Term Frequency) and TF-IDF analysis
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for theme identification
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)
- **Network Analysis**: Co-occurrence networks for keyword clustering

## NLP Pipeline Best Practices:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminate linguistic noise
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert text to structured data for ML analysis
- **Validation**: Statistical measures for topic coherence and model quality

## Key NLP Applications in Policy Analysis:
- **Document Classification**: Categorizing policy approaches (restrictive/moderate/permissive)
- **Theme Extraction**: Identifying core topics and their relative importance
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Measuring institutional attitudes toward technology adoption
- **Keyword Analysis**: Finding most frequent and significant terms

## Technical Implementation:
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy for natural language processing
- **Algorithms**: Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forest for classification
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F-measure for model performance
- **Data Sources**: Social media posts, academic documents, policy texts

## Quality Assurance:
- **Inter-rater Agreement**: Multiple researchers coding for reliability
- **Cross-validation**: Testing model performance across different datasets
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias in classification
- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking changes in language and topics over time

## PolicyCraft Applications:
- **Automated Theme Detection**: Extract policy themes from university documents
- **Classification Confidence**: Measure certainty in policy categorization
- **Keyword Weighting**: Assign importance scores to policy terms
- **Bias Mitigation**: Ensure fair analysis across different institution types
