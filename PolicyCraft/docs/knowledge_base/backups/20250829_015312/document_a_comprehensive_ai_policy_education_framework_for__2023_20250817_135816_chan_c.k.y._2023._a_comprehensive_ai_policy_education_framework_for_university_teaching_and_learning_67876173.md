## Abstract
This study aims to develop an AI education policy for higher education by examining the perceptions and implications of text generative AI technologies. Data was collected from 457 students and 180 teachers and staff across various disciplines in Hong Kong universities, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Based on the findings, the study proposes an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework to address the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university teaching and learning. This framework is organized into three dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Opera- tional. The Pedagogical dimension concentrates on using AI to improve teaching and learning outcomes, while the Governance dimension tackles issues related to privacy, security, and accountability. The Operational dimension addresses matters concern- ing infrastructure and training. The framework fosters a nuanced understanding of the implications of AI integration in academic settings, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities and can take appropriate actions accordingly. Highlights • ProposedAI Ecological Education Policy Framework for university teaching and learning. • Threedimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Operational AI Policy Frame- work. • Qualitativeand quantitative data collected from students, teachers, and staff. • Tenkey areas identified for planning an AI policy in universities. • Studentsshould play an active role in drafting and implementing the policy.

## Content-Based Recommendations
1. an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework to address the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university teaching and learning.
2. generative AI could be used to provide personalized feedback and support to students, helping them to identify areas of weakness and improve their skills in an adaptive manner (Kasneci et al, 2023; Sinhaliz et al.
3. if such a trend continues, policymakers may fail to realize AI in education’s transformative potential and may fail to sufficiently fund, regulate, and consider AI in education’s ethical implications.
4. a policy framework for integrating AI in higher education, taking into consideration aspects of teaching and learning as well as ethical and practical concerns.
5. AI and education policies should be developed through collaboration between different sectors and disciplines to ensure a comprehensive approach.
6. policymakers should develop a comprehensive plan for using AI in various aspects of education to ensure its effec- tive implementation.
7. policymakers should encourage the development of local innovations in AI for edu- cation to ensure that it meets the specific needs of their communities.
8. students and teachers recog- nize potential benefits and drawbacks of AI technologies, including providing guidance and personalized feedback, improving digital competence and academic performance, Table 2 (continued) Item Students Teachers N Mean Median SD N Mean Median SD If a fully online programme with the assistance of a personalized AI tutor was available, I would be willing to pursue my degree through this option.
9. familiarizing students with ethical issues, such as the boundaries between plagiarism and inspiration and appropriate situations for seeking help from AI.
10. “teaching students the potential of using generative AI properly and critically can benefit from students using AI hiddenly” and “relying on tools able to detect the use of a generative language model, while being aware of the limits of such tools.
