"""
Test Suite for PolicyCraft Database Operations.

This package contains test modules for the database functionality of the PolicyCraft
application, including tests for database models, queries, and data persistence.

Test files in this directory should focus on testing the database layer in isolation,
using test doubles for any external dependencies when necessary.
