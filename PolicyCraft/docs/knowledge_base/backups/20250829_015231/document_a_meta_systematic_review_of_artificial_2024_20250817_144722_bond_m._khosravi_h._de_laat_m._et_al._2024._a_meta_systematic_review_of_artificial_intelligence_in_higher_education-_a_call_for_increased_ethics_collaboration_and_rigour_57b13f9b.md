## Content-Based Recommendations
1. a need for greater ethical, methodologi- cal, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application.
2. future primary and secondary research (Sutton et al.
3. further atten- tion also needs to be paid to learning design, alongside further qualitative research.
4. neuro measurements can help fill this gap by providing further insight into learner mental states and found that facial measurements had a higher adoption rate than EEGs, although cognitive constructs were measured in more EEG studies.
5. further investigation is needed of algorithms that are based on a semantic approach, as well as further development of hybrid systems.
6. user information could be explored along with information from different sources, such as social media, to build more complete profiles.
7. applications can be sorted with a 95% accuracy rate when using the support vector machine method.
8. ethical implications, digital literacy, predictive model- ling, and machine learning should now be part of any nursing curriculum, which Charow et al.
9. using AES in small institu- tions would be challenging, owing to the large number of pre-scored exams required for calibration, and although automatic grading has been used for a wide range of tasks, from short answer tests to essays (Burney & Ahmad, 2022), they found that AES might not be appropriate for all forms of writing.
10. the need for more uni- fied, standardised frameworks that incorporate ethical principles and advocate for the development of multidisciplinary teams (Charow et al.
