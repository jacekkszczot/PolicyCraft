## Content-Based Recommendations
1. have a broader understanding of the societal impact of generative AI.
2. consider their strategic approach to AI, review, and update policies, and communicate guidance to students.
3. rush into using it in teaching.
4. be aware of copyright concerns.
5. then be given to licensing options to avoid inequality.
6. always be carefully reviewed and adapted.
7. be reviewed carefully as above Customising materials (simplifying language, adjusting to different reading levels, creating tailored activities for different interests) Generally, when asked to customise material, generative AI won’t introduce new concepts, and so is less likely to introduce factually incorrect information Providing custom feedback to students.
8. not be used to mark student work, but it can be a useful tool for assisting with personalised feedback The Department for Education has recently published the results of a call for evidence on the use of generative AI in education.
9. avoid posting any work that isn’t your own, and any personal information into ChatGPT, as it might well be used as part of the training data.
10. never put personal information into any system that a University or College hasn’t got a proper contract in place with and made a full assessment if it’s data privacy policies etc.
