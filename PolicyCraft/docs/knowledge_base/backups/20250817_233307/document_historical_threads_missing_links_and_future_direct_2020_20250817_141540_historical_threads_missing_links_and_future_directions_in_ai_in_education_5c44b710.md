## Content-Based Recommendations
1. three areas of focus: ethnographies of AI in use, links with the philosophy of education, and more meaningful inter- actions with other academic communities working in AIed.
2. one important way forward could be the use of more participative approaches, enabling the development of insight and changes in practice simultaneously.
3. embed AI technologies in education.
4. be protected at a transnational level, as national approaches are unlikely to work particularly given the global 230 B.
5. better understand how these happen in practice.
6. to make a distinction (yet also note the complex relationship between) academics from the learning and cognitive sciences and those who work in the commercial sector.
7. that this special issue is intended to identify and examine.
8. for Teaching and Learning.
