## Content-Based Recommendations
1. educators using multiple choice test for assessment may consider outsmarting the system by taking advantage of the current limitations of generative AI platforms, such as their inability to interpret visual media or understand up-to-date information beyond its training data.
2. avoiding assignments and exams that are overly formulaic, to the point where it becomes indistinguishable if they were completed by a computer.
3. having students assess ChatGPT's responses or compare a ChatGPT- produced research paper with the original to bolster their critical thinking skills.
4. update assessment policies, develop guidelines for staff and students, scaffold AI skills development, and find ways to leverage technology in the classroom.
5. not be unexpected (Geerling et al.
6. be on crafting assessments that encourage the development of students' creative and critical thinking skills (Rudolph et al.
7. create clear policies for the deployment of AI which is a vital step towards cultivating a learning environment where this technology is adopted responsibly and with transparency (Gimpel et al.
8. review and update misconduct policies to clarify what uses of AI may be counted as plagiarism and what are best practices to ensure academic integrity is upheld (Lim et al.
9. ensure that the students are familiar with the policies related to academic integrity and comprehend the potential repercussions of engaging in academic misconduct (Atlas, 2023).
10. be placed on future proofing subjects and degrees (Crawford et al.
